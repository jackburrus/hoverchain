    <h1>Decentralized Finance: The Future of Banking</h1>
    <p>Decentralized finance (DeFi) is revolutionizing the financial industry, offering unprecedented opportunities for financial inclusion and innovation. With DeFi, users can access a wide range of financial services without the need for traditional intermediaries.</p>

    <p>One of the key components of DeFi is the Ethereum Name Service (ENS), which allows users to replace complex Ethereum addresses with human-readable names. For example, instead of sending funds to <span class="ethereum-address">0xE35ef95A80839C3c261197B6c93E5765C9A6a31a</span>, users can simply use the ENS name <strong>alice.eth</strong>.</p>

    <p>Smart contracts play a crucial role in DeFi platforms, facilitating automated transactions and enforcing complex financial agreements. For instance, the <span class="ethereum-address">0xCe23551A2Ad6845C75aD7e68B1b8B8B8F4059d07</span> contract governs the lending protocol on the <strong>Compound Finance</strong> platform, allowing users to earn interest on their cryptocurrency holdings.</p>

    <p>Furthermore, decentralized exchanges (DEXs) like <strong>Uniswap</strong> are powered by smart contracts, enabling peer-to-peer trading of digital assets. Users can trade tokens directly from their Ethereum wallets, providing unprecedented liquidity and market access.</p>

    <p>In conclusion, DeFi represents a paradigm shift in the way we think about finance. By leveraging blockchain technology and smart contracts, DeFi platforms offer greater transparency, security, and accessibility compared to traditional financial systems.</p>
